This assignment focuses on problems relating to introductory statistics (Week 6), single-factor ANOVA (Week 7), and linear regression (Week 8). It involves identifying and applying appropriate statistical analyses to the data sets provided, interpreting the outcomes of analyses, and linking those outcomes back to the biological questions that motivated analyses. It forms 15% of the overall grade for BIO2010 and is **due 11:55 PM on Thursday 22 September (Week 9)**.

**To complete the assignment:**

* get your answers by entering and running the R code required in the code chunks provided (remember, you can run each chunk by clicking the green triangle at the top right of the chunk); 
* type your answers in the spaces also provided (marks are based on your typed answers, but including your code helps markers understand how you got them);
* save your work as you go (press *Command-S* or *Control-S* keys, click *File > Save* in the menu bar, or click the disc icon in the toolbar)!

**To create a PDF of the assignment for submission:**

* create an HTML file and open it in a browser (click *Preview* in the toolbar and *Open in Browser* at the top left of the file), then save the file as a PDF (click *File > Print > Save as PDF > Save*); or 
* create a Word file (click the arrow next to *Preview* in the toolbar and select *Knit to Word*), then save or export the file as a PDF.  

**Check that your PDF displays all information correctly, then upload it to the Moodle Dropbox by the due date.**

## Problem set 1: food and stalk-eyed flies

Stalk-eyed flies (*Cyrtodiopsis dalmanni*) have eyes at the ends of long stalks that extend horizontally from each side of the head. Longer eye spans (the combined lengths of stalks from tip to tip) enhance attractiveness to mates and success in competitive interactions. Is eye span affected by the quality of food that flies eat? To find out, researchers reared two groups of flies on different foods, then recorded each fly's eye span in millimetres. One group of flies was fed corn (a high-quality food), while the other group of flies was fed cotton wool (a low-quality food). Each fly per group was reared singly, and therefore represents an independent sampling unit. The data are contained in the file 'flies.csv', which you can load by running the chunk below. 

```{r}
# Run this chunk to load the data for Problem set 1
flies <- read_csv("./flies.csv", 
                  col_names = TRUE, na = "NA",
                  col_types = list(food = col_factor(),
                                   eyeSpan = col_double()))
glimpse(flies, width = 75)

## Problem set 2: parasites and traffic accidents

The parasite *Toxoplasma gondii* infects warm-blooded vertebrates, including 30–60% of humans, in most countries. A short phase of acute infection is followed by a latent phase (life-long presence of *Toxoplasma* cysts in nerve and muscle tissues), in which infected subjects are considered to be asymptomatic. Researchers noticed, however, that some subjects with latent infections had longer reaction times in laboratory tests, and speculated that latent infection might influence the performance of subjects in real-life situations.

To find out, the researchers surveyed a sample of 15- to 29-year-old drivers from Prague who had been involved in traffic accidents. Each driver was given a blood test at the time of the accident (to rule out intoxication), which revealed any latent infection by *Toxoplasma*. The researchers also surveyed a control sample of drivers of the same age living in the same area who had not been in any accidents. The data are contained in the file 'drivers.csv', which you can load by running the chunk below. 

```{r}
# Run this chunk to load the data for Problem set 2
drivers <- read_csv("./drivers.csv", 
                    col_names = TRUE, na = "NA",
                    col_types = list(infectionStatus = col_factor(),
                                     accidentStatus = col_factor()))
glimpse(drivers, width = 75)

## Problem set 3: maths and readers' research areas

Does adding maths to a scientific paper make readers think that it has more value, or does it depend on the reader's research area? Researchers sent two abstracts of scientific papers to each of 200 people with postgraduate degrees. Before sending the two abstracts to each person, the researchers chose one of the abstracts at random and added a meaningless sentence describing an unrelated mathematical model (the maths itself wasn't meaningless, but it had no conceptual link to the subject matter of the abstract). The other abstract had no maths added. 

Participants were asked to score the quality of the research in each abstract on a scale from 1 to 100, and to also state the research area of their postgraduate degree: science including maths and technology (Sci); medicine (Med); humanities including social science (Hum); or other (Other). Then, for each person, the researchers calculated the perceived advantage of adding maths to a paper (mathsAdvantage) as the score for the abstract with maths added minus the score for the abstract without maths added. The data are contained in the file 'maths.csv', which you can load by running the chunk below. 

```{r}
# Run this chunk to load the data for Problem set 3
maths <- read_csv("./maths.csv", 
                  col_names = TRUE, na = "NA",
                  col_types = list(degree = col_factor(),
                                   mathsAdvantage = col_double()))
glimpse(maths, width = 75)

## Problem set 3: Metabolism and body size

The relationship between size and energy metabolism has fascinated biologists for over a century. An organism’s metabolic rate is the amount of energy that the organism expends on life processes in a given time period, and is expected to scale with body size because larger bodies have more metabolising tissue. To understand the relationship between metabolism and body size in primates, a researcher gathered data on metabolic rate (in watts) and body size in terms of mass (in grams) for 17 primate species. The data are contained in the file 'primates.csv', which you can load by running the chunk below. 

```{r}
# Run this chunk to load the data for Problem set 3
primates <- read_csv("./primates.csv", 
                     col_names = TRUE, na = "NA",
                     col_types = list(species = col_factor(),
                                      mass = col_double(),
                                      metabolic_rate = col_double()))
glimpse(primates, width = 75)
```

**EXERCISE 18: Based on the research description above, what are the null and alternate hypotheses of interest, and what parameter estimate do hypotheses focus on? (2 MARKS)**

**EXERCISE 19: Fit the appropriate linear model for testing the null hypothesis using untransformed data, and check the model's assumptions. Do you think they are adequately met in this case? Give 2 reasons to justify your answer. You can work out your answer using the chunk below. (3 MARKS)**

```{r}
# Use this chunk to complete Exercise 19


```

**EXERCISE 20: Re-fit the linear model using ln-transformed data (where 'ln' means natural log) for one or both variables as necessary to adequately meet the model's assumptions. Which variable or variables did you end up transforming, and why? Explain your answer with reference to the model's assumptions. You can work out your answer using the chunk below. (3 MARKS)**
